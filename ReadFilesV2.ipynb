(in comparison to the soviet pavilion, which resembled a large refrigerator!) thirdly, the spokane expo of 1974 was not the first time that the u.s.s.r. exhibited at a u.s. expo. they had a large pavilion at the new york world's fair of 1939. all in all, however, i would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of world's fairs | positive |\n",
